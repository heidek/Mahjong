# Mahjong

This is a module for Japanese mahjong. Currently, it implements Hand and Tile objects, and provides a check for hands to see if they are winning (contain 4 sets of three and a pair) or not.

Uses Pytest for testing.

Further development includes implementing scoring and creating a game using this as a framework.
